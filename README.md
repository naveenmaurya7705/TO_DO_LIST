`#To Do List`


*  This is simple Todo list with vanilla JS (as you see in the hosting page). Vanilla JS means we are not going to use no plugins, no libraries, nothing.

  
 `This list include certain Features :`

*  A minimal design with HTML and CSS, it should look nice (no libraries, no frameworks).

*  A text box at the top is added in todo to add  items in the list.

*  Add button: when a user clicks on the button,  that todo item will be added to the to-do items list.

*  A delete button: also here to delete the todo item completely from the list.

* A checkbox:are added to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items).

`Extra points for creativity:`

* I Created a about section with the help of about button we can see information about author .

* In same way by clicking the clear button we can hide about section for the page.
