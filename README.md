#This is simple Todo list with vanilla JS (as you see in the GIF below). Vanilla JS means no plugins, no libraries, nothing.
 This list include certain Features :

A minimal design with HTML and CSS, it should look nice (no libraries, no frameworks).

A text box at the top is added in todo to add  items in the list.

Add button: when a user clicks on the button,  that todo item will be added to the to-do items list.

A delete button: also here to delete the todo item completely from the list.

A checkbox:are added to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items).

Extra points for creativity:

I Created a about section with the help of about button we can see information about author .

In same way by clicking the clear button we can hide about section for the page.
